### 2.0.0 [February 23, 2025]

- **BREAKING CHANGE**: Updated default host to our new synchronous API subdomain: sync.api.docspring.com. (EU customers should use sync.api-eu.docspring.com). Removed all custom polling code from library since this logic is now handled by the API service running on our sync subdomain
- Fixed User-Agent header: docspring-elixir-x.x.x

### 1.0.0 [Jan 30, 2025]

- Initial support for template versioning (before we decided to release the synchronous API first.)

### 0.0.4 [August 5, 2022]

- Initial release
